# luakai.nvim
 A lua colorscheme inspired by monokai palette.

## Credits
I can't stress enough how this plugin is not an "original" work. The wonderful palette is taken from
- [Sonokai](https://github.com/sainnhe/sonokai)

and the plugin structure, as well the setup options, are copied basically one-to-one from

- [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim)

All credits go to the authors and contributers of these two amazing colorschemes.

## Configurations
See the configuration section of [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim).
